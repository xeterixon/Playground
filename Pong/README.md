Canvas Pong with Leap Motion support.
=====================================
As a lab-day I took upon myself to try out the Leap Motion controller.
What better to use as a testing-plattform than Pong?

I borrowed the Javascript implementation from https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-pong/ and hooked up Leap Motion to control the paddles.
Right hand controls the right paddle och left hand the left paddle. Simple enough.

Not much is changed in the original code.


Below is the original readme.

Canvas Pong
===========

This is a small experiment to implement a version of the classic Pong game in an HTML <canvas>.

 * You can find the [game here](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/demo.html)
 * You can find out [how it works](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/index.html)

You can also play this game in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omimkinlomnncbmnceacpkmlbfaapojj?hl=en-US)


NOTES
=====

 * No support for mobile devices (need to handle touch events instead of key input)
